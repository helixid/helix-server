# helix-api production image. helix-api *is* this repo now (no more
# nested helix-api/ subdirectory -- see docs/decisions.md for why), so this
# builds the workspace root package directly.
#
# @helixid/did-hedera is declared as a pnpm git dependency
# (github:helixid/helix-sdk-js#path:did-hedera, see pnpm-workspace.yaml's
# allowBuilds), but that repo is currently *private* -- this image has no
# git credentials for it, so a plain `pnpm install` can't fetch it here
# (the same reason each example's node.Dockerfile vendors its sibling
# packages instead of installing them from git).
#
# TODO(helixid/helix-sdk-js visibility): once helix-sdk-js is public, delete
# the vendoring below, restore `context: ../..` / `dockerfile: Dockerfile`
# in both examples' docker-compose.yml, and go back to a plain
# `pnpm install --filter @helixid/api`.
#
# Build context: the parent directory containing all four split repos.

# `pnpm deploy` (isolate prod-only deps into a self-contained directory,
# dropping workspace symlinks) is unreliable once the deployed package
# *is* the workspace root itself: its --prod output still listed
# devDependencies in package.json, and re-running `prisma generate`
# against that output failed to resolve @prisma/client even though the
# symlink was actually present -- some part of `pnpm deploy`'s dependency
# re-resolution behaves differently for the root package than for a
# nested one. Simpler and reliable: carry this /app checkout's own
# node_modules forward as-is -- it already has a correctly generated
# Prisma client (from the build step above) and every prod dependency
# resolved, at the cost of also carrying devDependencies into the image
# (no lean prod-only reinstall). Revisit if image size becomes a real
# concern; correctness over leanness for now.
